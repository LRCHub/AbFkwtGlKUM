Are you getting, Tired of hanging around here?
Is it bringing you down?
We've been talking, about how we get enough here
If we got out of town

All the city towers over us
And all our problems make us powerless
Let's get somewhere where the both of us
Come rising up, come rising up

Where we could be giants
(Bigger than the walls that hide us)
Breaking all the laws of science
(Looking at a sea of diamonds)
If we could be, we could be
(Oh) Giants (Oh) Giants
If we could be
Giants, Giants
(Giants, giants, if we could be, giants,
Giants. Giants, giants, if we could be giants, giants)

I don't wanna, be the one you can push by
At the back of the room
I would rather, ride with you to the big sky
At the heart of the moon

All the city towers over us
And all our problems make us powerless
Let's get somewhere where the both of us
Can come rising up

Where we could be giants
(Bigger than the walls that hide us)
Breaking all the laws of science
(Looking at a sea of diamonds)
If we could be, we could be
(Oh) Giants (Oh) Giants
If we could be
Giants, Giants
(Giants, giants, if we could be, giants, giants)

Where we could be giants
Bigger than the walls that hide us
Breaking all the laws of science
Looking at a sea of diamonds
If we could be, we could be
(Oh) Giants (Oh) Giants
If we could be
Giants, Giants

(Giants, giants)
