Through silence
Hear the thunder in you
I know you're mind is
Looking for a truce
Don't need reminding
We're living proof
So walk with me and I'll walk with you
So now we're standing on the edge
Our backs against the wall
A penthouse view
On our own two
And now we're standing tall
We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
光り輝く
栄光の場所
We can be giants giants
In the chaos
Our kingdom fell
Stole heaven
So we gave'em hell
In the pieces
We found ourselves
So fight for me
I'll fight as well
So now we're standing on the edge
Our backs against the wall
A penthouse view
On our own two
And now we're standing tall
We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
光り輝く
栄光の場所
We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
'cause every one of us
Has always been enough
We can be
We can be giants
We can be giants giants
We can be giants giants
光り輝く
栄光の場所
We can be giants giants
